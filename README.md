# MusicPlayeAddin

A small and useful music player which can be added in Excel as an Addin. Work in progress.

## Why use it?

While working in Excel (or Word, or anywhere) we like to listen to some music. But playing it in the background in a different player, we have to switch windows and that can cost time. The idea of this project is to embbed a basic music player inside Excel (for now) as a Ribbon Add-In.

## Details

Made in Microsoft VSTO, it is still a work in progress. Plan to add various features with time.
